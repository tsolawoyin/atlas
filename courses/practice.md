I found myself writing an exam this year which includes physics.

Back when I'm fully into all these O'level stuffs, my physics is hot and cool but it was quite unfortunate that programming has formed a new neural circuit in my brain and I couldn't figure out which circuit is related to physics anymore. 

I took a mock test three months prior to the exam and I had 47/100. Imagine. My previous self would be really ashamed of my new self regarding this score. 

What can I do? Reread all my textbooks asap. Hmm. Turns out to be a bad strategy. My brain feels it has studied these materials the upteenth time. I wasn't getting the old vibes. Bought fearless, nescafe, monster, predator, and any energy drink you can think of, but all to no avail. And for the love of God, I can't afford to fail. Failure is not even part of the option at all. 

Luckily for me, one of my students recommends lamlad physics. This text was practice-oriented. Less talk, plenty practice questions. And these questions are not moderately difficult, they were very difficult!

I had one advantage. I am very comfortable with difficult things. And I managed to complete this one text and I aced my physics in the main exam. 89/100. Cool eh? Yupyup.

Moral lesson. If you find yourself in my situation someday, do not re-read, I repeat, do not reread! Just practice 24/7. All those information are still there somewhere in your brain but garbage collected. Force yourself to remember by practicing. 

And that's why I created Boots to help you practice. Boots algorithm is sophisticatedly written to give you the hardest practice of your life. Smiles. Not kidding though. Thanks for reading to the end.
