You will die, and that makes you the lucky one. Some people are not going to die because they are not going to be born.

Every fertile female has over hundreds of thousand of eggs in her ovaries, and she releases one during each menstrual cycle. Yes, just one out of the hundreds of thousands. In some rare cases she release two or more. So if we assume only one egg is released per month, then only twelve eggs will be released per year, since we have 12 months in a year. This calculation is only valid if she doesn't get pregnant at any time because egg-release is paused until post-pregnancy period.

If ovaries is prison yards, eggs are the prisoners. And each month an egg is freed, freed to go on a very dangerous and perilous journey. 

When an egg is released from the ovary, it enters into the oviduct(fallopian tube), the road that leads to the uterus(womb). This lonely egg leaves it fellow egg-mate to go on a lonely journey into the uterus. Sure, the female hormone system and reproductive system provide some escorts to guard this precious choosen egg. 

During this journey, the egg hopes to meet the special package called sperm on its way. And with every step it takes it prays there is a sperm nearby. And if unfortunately for this egg it doesn't find any special package (sperm) until it gets to the uterus, it is sent to its doom and becomes washed out in a pool of dirty water called menstruation.

But let's assume this precious egg found a special package on it's way, then gamete fusion process is initiated. Sorry for the gamete fusion jargon, I mean the process where the sperm enters the egg is started. 

But there is a problem. The egg has several protective layer around it. The zona pelucida and cumulus. These densely packed structures is there to ensure that the sperm of dog or the sperm of chimpazee won't enter a human egg. We can akin them to password checkers. They ask the sperms, hey bro, what's the password into this egg? And a dog sperm might respond with wo wo wo, these password checker will be like, hey bro, you are in the wrong location, sorry.

Secondly, because the zona pellucida and cumulus are densely packed tissue around the egg, just one sperm cannot enter even if it is a human sperm. It needs the help of other sperms. And unfortunately, it doesn't need the help of two more sperms, or the help of two thousand more sperms, it needs the help of million other sperms. Imagine just to bring one sperm inside an egg, million of other sperm must sacrifice their lives. And if mistakenly two sperm enter the egg, then the two sperm plus the egg itself are all sent to their doom. But the egg can't afford to die, it has very advanced door such that when a sperm manage to enter, the door is shut extremely tightly to prevent any other sperm from entering.

Then let's assume this process was successful, the egg is happy, the egg extracts whatever mr sperm brings from the other side and join it with hers to make a complete diploid nucleus and uses the sugar left of the sperm as refreshment on her lonely journey.

The egg continues it's journey into the uterus and on getting there the gatekeeper of the uterus will verify if she has the package in her. If she has then implantation process is started. Implantation here means the egg is welcomed nicely and given a nice house to stay in the uterus(womb). The egg the stays here for the next nine months, growing and developing each until nine month is complete. 

Mind you, she might not reach the nine month threshold in which she dies and get washed out in a pool of blood. We have a very fancy name for this, miscarriage.

But let's assume he/she (at this point, gender has been determined) meets this nine threshold, then he/she is ready to leave her temporary home in the uterus and go into the world to make an impact. She is sent out through the cervix, an opening beneath the uterus, into the vagina, and out into the world, and he/she cries not because of pain, or the intense light entering into his/her eye, but cries because he/she imagined how far she has come and he/she shed tears of joy because he/she is the lucky one. 

Thank you. 

My name is Temidayo Olawoyin. Thank you.

Some people will never die because they will never be born.

Every fertile female has hundreds of thousands of eggs in her ovaries, and she releases just one during each menstrual cycle. In rare cases, two or more may be released. But if we assume only one egg is released per month, that amounts to twelve eggs a year—if she doesn’t get pregnant, of course, since pregnancy pauses ovulation until after the baby is born.

If ovaries were prison yards, eggs would be the prisoners. Each month, one egg is freed, embarking on a dangerous, perilous journey.

Once released from the ovary, the egg enters the oviduct (fallopian tube)—the road that leads to the uterus (womb). This egg leaves its fellow inmates behind to go on a lonely journey to the uterus. Sure, the female reproductive system provides some escorts in the form of hormones and support, but this egg is on its own, hoping to meet a very special package: sperm.

As it moves along, it prays there’s sperm nearby. If, unfortunately, no sperm is found before it reaches the uterus, the egg is doomed, washed away in a pool of blood during menstruation.

But let’s assume the egg meets its special package on the way. The process of gamete fusion begins. In simpler terms, this is when the sperm enters the egg.

However, there’s a catch. The egg has protective layers around it, called the zona pellucida and the cumulus. These dense layers ensure that only the right sperm can enter—no dog or chimpanzee sperm allowed! Think of them as password checkers. If a dog’s sperm shows up barking "woof woof woof," the egg’s security layers respond, "Sorry, bro, wrong place."

But even for human sperm, breaking through these layers isn’t easy. It takes more than one sperm to do it. In fact, millions of sperm must sacrifice themselves just to let one inside. And if two sperm manage to enter, all is lost—the egg, along with the extra sperm, is doomed. To prevent this, the egg has an advanced security feature: once one sperm successfully enters, the door slams shut tightly, blocking any others.

Now, let’s assume everything goes according to plan. The egg happily accepts the sperm’s contribution, combines it with her own material to form a complete diploid nucleus, and even uses some of the sperm’s leftover sugars for refreshment.

The journey continues, and upon reaching the uterus, the gatekeeper checks if the egg has the proper package inside. If so, the implantation process begins. The egg is welcomed and given a cozy place to settle for the next nine months.

But it’s not always smooth sailing. Sometimes, the egg doesn’t make it to the full nine months, leading to miscarriage—a sad but all-too-common fate.

However, if everything goes well, the fetus reaches full term, ready to leave the temporary home of the uterus. It exits through the cervix and into the world.

The baby is born, crying not because of pain or the bright lights, but because it has come such a long way. Out of millions of others that could have been, this one made it. It is the lucky one—the result of a delicate process between chance and nature, a rare opportunity that became life. And with its first breath, it reminds us: life is special, not because everyone gets it, but because it’s rare.
