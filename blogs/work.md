#Whisper of my room

Whenever I sit in my room, feeling the breeze and listening to the rustle of the leavesand the chirp of the birds, I feel as though life will forever be peaceful. And so do those who visit my room.

The tranquility comes from the mango tree and some unknown trees by the window, which breathe air like life into the room and all day and all night. Even on sunny days, the trees are ventilators.

But it becomes cold room when it rains. The concrete floor, unpainted cement wall and the metal burglaries indulge in the coldness. Even the bed nd blanket can't curb the stinging air.

People comment on the rooms freshness but cry when it turns icy. They even wonder how I manage to stay when it rains. But I can't control. I wish I could.

Like the room, life oscillates between its comforts and discomforts. We often believe beauty will endure which make us feel abandoned when thing unravel. While we can't resist this shift, we just need strength to navigate them.

When bad time comes, don't believe it has come to stay. Do regret or blame, focus and eat well. If happiness is elusive, muster a smile and embrace love.

Sometimes it feels like the storm will never end, but good times will return. And don't fear the good times will pass away - just relish it. Have fun, find pleasure, but don't misuse it.

Whispers of My Room

Whenever I sit in my room, I feel the breeze gently brushing through, carrying the rustle of leaves and the song of birds. In these moments, life feels like it will always be this peaceful. Everyone who visits can sense it too.

This calm comes from the mango tree and the unknown companions by the window, breathing life into the room with every gust of fresh air. Day and night, they stand as silent sentinels, even on the hottest days, acting as natural ventilators.

But when the rain falls, the room changes. The concrete floor, unpainted cement walls, and iron bars soak in the chill. Even my bed and blanket can’t fend off the sting of the cold air.

People praise the room’s freshness but shiver when it turns icy. They wonder how I manage to stay here through the rain. But I have no control over it—I wish I did.

Life, much like my room, sways between comfort and discomfort. We cling to beauty, thinking it will last forever, only to feel abandoned when it fades. We can’t stop this ebb and flow, but we can find the strength to navigate it.

When hard times come, don’t believe they’ve come to stay. Don’t regret or cast blame—just keep your focus, nourish yourself, and breathe. If happiness feels out of reach, muster a smile and embrace love where you find it.

The storm may feel endless, but good times will always return. And when they do, don’t fear their passing—relish them. Enjoy the ride, seek pleasure, but never abuse it.
