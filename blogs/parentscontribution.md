# Parent's role in their child(ren) education

Last year's JAMB statistics showed that most of those that took the exam failed. A whooping 76% scored less than 200. For those of us that don't have much time to do the mathematics, it meaNs 760,000 candidates failed out of 1 million.

Many people commented on this high rate of failure and many gave one or two reasons. Such reasons include

- High rate of social media engagement. 
- High poverty rate
- Corrupted and failed educational sector
- etc.

While these factors contributed in one way or the other, this post is about how many parents are particularly failing in the aspect of their taking care of their child's or children's education and what parents should do about it.

Each and every child you come across right from time always have at least one religious status. A child is either a muslim, or a christian, and in some rare cases these days, a traditional worshipper. None of these children came with a religion while emanating from the cervix of their mother, it is when they start growing up that they started learning what God is, what church is, what prayer is, what fasting is, and what many more religious concepts is. 

And who taught them these things? Their parents. 

The parents hold the strongest influence in a child's life as children grow up to know and love their parents. Parents provide food, shelter, good health, clothing, etc. for their children. And as consequence, children tend to love, support, and listen to their parents even if their parent is hated by the entire world. Take for instance, Pablo Escobar, the famous drug baron, had two children, and despite the fact that the U.S.A and the entire world wanted to put a bullet in this man's head, he was completely loved by his two children.

Over the course of time, I noticed some particular trends in the way parents handle their children's education. Parents start investing in their chidlren education right from kindergatten, to nursery and primary levels, to secondary and beyond. All parent mean well but this same parent jeopardize their efforts by providing weapon of brain damaging devices to their kids. Two of those devices are television and mobile devices. You know it's like wishing to be have good health and body but eating junk foods at every oppportunity.

And besides, most parents think it's the job of teachers to take care of their child's education whereas it is in the hands of the parent.
