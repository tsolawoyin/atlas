## **Target Members**  
The UI Campus Discord server was established to foster a strong and connected student community at the University of Ibadan. It was initiated by passionate students, Temidayo Olawoyin and Veronica Apera, with the goal of creating a hub where UI students and alumni can interact, support each other, and grow together. It is designed for all students of UI, including:
- Freshers (100 Level students)  
- Staylites (200 Level and above)  
- Alumni  
- Students from all faculties and departments

## **Server Structure**  
The server is organized into **categories**, each representing a faculty. Under each faculty, there are **departmental channels** where students can interact within their specific departments.

### **Categories and Channels**  
#### **1. UI-Community (General Access for All UI Students)**  
This is the top-level category accessible to every member of the server. It contains essential channels such as:
- **#general-chats** – Open discussions for all UI students
- **#announcements** – Official updates and notices
- **#school-updates** – News and updates related to UI
- **#freshers-help** – A support channel for freshers seeking guidance

#### **2. Faculty-Based Categories**  
Each faculty has its own category, which contains:
- **#faculty-announcements** – General updates related to the faculty
- **#faculty-general-chat** – Discussions among students within the same faculty
- **Departmental Channels** – Each department under the faculty has its own channel

Example Structure:
- **College of Medicine (Category)**
  - **#medicine**
  - **#nursing**
  - **#physiotherapy**
  
- **Faculty of Science (Category)**
  - **#mathematics**
  - **#chemistry**
  - **#physics**

Each departmental channel consists of students from all levels, including alumni, allowing for cross-level interaction.

## **Role Assignment and Access Control**  
Roles are assigned to control access and ensure a structured interaction within the server.

### **1. Core Roles:**  
- **"ui" Role** – Grants access to the **UI-Community** category (open to all students)

### **2. Faculty-Based Roles:**  
- Examples: "science", "arts", "law", "com" (commerce), etc.
- Grants access to the respective **faculty category** (faculty announcements and general chat)

### **3. Department-Based Roles:**  
- Examples: "medicine", "mathematics", "engineering", "elect-elect" (Electrical Engineering), etc.
- Grants access to a **specific departmental channel**

### **4. Level-Based Roles:**  
- Examples: "100L", "200L", "300L", "400L"
- Helps identify students’ levels but does not affect access

### **Example Role-Based Access:**  
If Fatima has the roles **"ui"**, **"science"**, and **"mathematics"**, she will have access to:
1. **UI-Community** category (for general discussions across UI)
2. **Faculty of Science** category (for faculty-level interactions)
3. **Mathematics Department** channel (for departmental discussions)

By default, a member only sees:
- **Their Faculty Category** (with its announcements and general chat)
- **Their Departmental Channel**
- **The UI-Community Category**

Students **cannot** access channels of other faculties or departments unless they are assigned the appropriate roles.

## **Membership Target & Growth**  
- **Current Members:** Less than 100
- **Target Membership:** 1 million+ UI students and alumni

## **Purpose of the UI Campus Community**

2. **Facilitate academic support** – Provide a platform for students to help each other academically
